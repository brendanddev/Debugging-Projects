# Debugging-Projects

Welcome to my Debugging Projects repository! This repo contains a collection of projects focused on debugging and troubleshooting various coding issues. These projects cover different programming languages, tools, and techniques, and are intended to document my learning journey and provide solutions to common debugging challenges.

## Overview

In my debugging projects, I have utilized different concepts and methodologies, including:

- **Test Cases**: I implement unit tests to identify and isolate bugs in the code. By writing comprehensive test cases, I can ensure that my code functions as expected and can detect regressions when changes are made.

- **Mutation Testing**: This technique involves intentionally introducing small changes (mutations) into the code to evaluate the effectiveness of the existing test cases. This helps me assess the robustness of my tests and identify areas for improvement.

- **Error Logging**: I incorporate error logging to capture runtime errors and exceptions. By analyzing logs, I can trace the source of bugs and gain insights into unexpected behavior.

- **Code Review**: Collaborating with peers for code reviews has been instrumental in identifying potential issues early in the development process. This practice not only improves code quality but also enhances my debugging skills through feedback.

- **Debugging Tools**: I leverage various debugging tools and IDE features to streamline the debugging process. This includes using breakpoints, watch variables, and call stacks to monitor the execution flow of the program.

Through these projects, I aim to document my learning journey, share useful techniques, and provide solutions to common coding challenges. My goal is to not only showcase my problem solving methods, but to create a resource to potentially help any developers in the future with their debugging practises.

Each folder contains a self-contained project with explanations of the issue, steps taken to resolve it, and the specified programming language used.
